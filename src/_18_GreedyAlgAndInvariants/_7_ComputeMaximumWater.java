 * An array of integers naturally defines a set of lines parallel to the Y-axis, starting from x = 0 as illustrated in Figure 18.4(a).
 * The goal of this problem is to find the pair of lines that together with the X-axis "trap" the most water.
 * <p>
 * Write a program which takes as input an integer array adn returns the pair of entries that trap the maximum amount of water.
