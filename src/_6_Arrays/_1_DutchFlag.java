/**
 * The quicksort algorithm for sorting arrays proceeds recursivelyâ€”it selects an element (the "pivot"), reorders the array to make all the elements less than or equal to the pivot appear first, followed by all the elements greater than the pivot. The two subarrays are then sorted recursively.
 * <p>
 * Write a program that takes an array A and an index i into A, and rearranges the elements such that all elements less than A[i] (the "pivot") appear first, followed by elements equal to the pivot, followed by elements greater than the pivot.
